# Traditional-Glyph-Forms
Contains around 800 character conversions. Mainly composed of the conversion table for [traditional glyph forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiu_zixing) (more info from [Chinese Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E8%88%8A%E5%AD%97%E5%BD%A2)) for [**traditional Chinese characters**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_characters), obtained from crawling the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page). Note that this is not a conversion table intended for converting between simplified and traditional Chinese characters. 

The last 260+ in the list are conversions for some [Japanese *shinjitai* characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjitai) obtained from [`kyujipy`](https://github.com/DrTurnon/kyujipy) made by [Emmanuel Ternon](https://github.com/DrTurnon/).
